monkeytype desktop

Source code will be posted here shortly. Uses webviewer to interface monkeytype to a mini webbrowser. Also can be allowed to interact with discord rich presence API.
I'm still new to this so I'm sorry if my code isn't the best.

With release of source code, I've also added live wpm, final wpm, or both to the program. These can be configured in the config.txt file to be fully turned off/on, or display any of the aforementioned stats in real time.

Also included the img file I used for the Discord Application, and the icon I used for windows for the program.


Built version of the program can be found in releases. This should work straight out of the box, you can just change config to your liking.
